# eh_GameJolt
Godot integration for GameJolt API. 

There alread some Godot-GameJolt integration plugins available but I wanted to learn both how to make plugins for Godot as well as a little bit about HTTP Requests and integrating with other Stores where I want to release my games. So this is a good oportunity!
