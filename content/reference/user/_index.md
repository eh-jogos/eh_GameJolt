Represents [Gamejolt API Users namespace](https://gamejolt.com/game-api/doc/users).

There is one custom node for each endpoint in this namespace, and when integrating your game with Gamejolt, these are the nodes you'll want to use directly. They have public methods to do the requests and signals to receive the results. You'll find more details on each of them.
